Projection system that projects player performance for the 2017 season. 

Pitchers - Project SIERA for 2017 and use that number to determine expected player value.

Hitters - Use statcast data to determine expected wOBA from 2016 season. Use this data, along with data from the 2014 and 2015 seasons, to calculate expected wOBA for the 2017 season. Add fielding and baserunning projections to determine expected player value for the 2017 season.
